Steak Razor
==================

A lightweight, open source NLHE HUD for OS X.
Supports the most
useful stats for low stakes cash games and SNGs.
Currently only supports the PS client.

# Installation
Instructions on building from source can be found
in `build-hud.sh`. To install the binary
directly just grab the .dmg from the repository.

# Setup
Run the app. Find the path to your hand history
folder and save it. Then, choose a layout setting
and save that too (see "Layout Settings").

# Use
Open your client as you normally would and drag
it to the desktop where the HUD is running. Tables
will be detected automatically and the menu will
disappear. Once an entire hand has been processed,
stats will become visible around the table window.

# Layout Settings
There are three layout settings options:

| Setting | Function                                                                                 |
|:--------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Auto    | Do not use                                                                               |
| Pro     | Displays all supported stats (this is basically the default setting)                     |
| Custom  | Displays stats based on the layout specified in the text field to the right of this menu |

Additional information on the `custom` setting can
be found by clicking on the text field in the
layout settings menu.

# Contributing
Contributions are always welcome.
This was my first 'real' project so some 
design choices were made before I knew
better. If you have
trouble building the repo or need an
explanation of how something works
feel free to open an issue or send
me an email.
